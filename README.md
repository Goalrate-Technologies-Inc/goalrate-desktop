# GoalRate Desktop

AI-powered daily planning for focused work. Built with [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app/), React 19, and Rust.

GoalRate Desktop is an offline-first desktop app that helps people stay focused on what matters. It combines a local markdown vault with an AI-driven daily loop to plan, prioritize, and reflect on your work.
